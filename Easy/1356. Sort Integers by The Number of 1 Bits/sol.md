# Algorithm Description

1. The code defines a method named `solve1` that counts the number of 1's in the binary representation of an integer.
2. Within the `solve1` method:
   - A counter `count` is initialized to zero.
   - A while loop runs as long as the integer \( x \) is non-zero.
   - Inside the loop, \( x \) is updated using a bitwise AND operation with \( x - 1 \). This operation essentially turns off the rightmost set bit of \( x \).
   - The counter is incremented for each iteration, effectively counting the number of 1's in \( x \).
   - The final count is returned.
3. The `sortByBits` method sorts the input array `arr` based on two criteria:
   - Primary: The number of 1's in the binary representation of each integer (using the `solve1` method).
   - Secondary: The actual value of the integer (in case of ties).
4. The sorted array is then returned.

## Time Complexity:
The **time complexity** of the `solve1` method is **O(k)**, where \( k \) is the number of 1's in the binary representation of the number. In the worst case, this can be approximated to **O(log n)**, where \( n \) is the value of the number.

The `sortByBits` method uses the `sorted` function which has a time complexity of **O(n log n)** for sorting \( n \) numbers. Given that for each number we're also counting its 1's in its binary representation, the overall time complexity can be approximated as **O(n log n * log m)**, where \( m \) is the average value of numbers in the array.

## Space Complexity:
The space complexity of the algorithm is **O(n)** for the space required to store the sorted array. Additionally, the `sorted` function and the `solve1` method use constant extra space, so the overall space complexity remains **O(n)**.
