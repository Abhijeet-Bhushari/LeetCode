# LeetCode 328.
# Problem Statement:
# Given the head of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list.
# The first node is considered odd, and the second node is even, and so on.
# Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.

# Test Cases:

# Example 1:
# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: [1,3,5,2,4]

# Example 2:
# Input: head = [2,1,3,5,6,4,7]
# Output: [2,3,6,7,1,5,4]

# Solution:
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def oddEvenList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # Initialize two dummy nodes to represent even and odd nodes.
        dummy_even = ListNode(0)
        dummy_odd  = ListNode(0)

        even = dummy_even
        odd = dummy_odd

        i = 1

        while head:
            if i % 2 == 0:
                # Even node, connect it to the even list.
                even.next = head
                even = even.next
            else:
                # Odd node, connect it to the odd list.
                odd.next = head
                odd = odd.next

            i += 1
            head = head.next

        # Connect the odd list to the even list to form the final result.
        odd.next = dummy_even.next
        even.next = None

        # Return the merged list of odd and even nodes.
        return dummy_odd.next
