## Problem Overview:
The problem seems to involve finding the number of arrays of length `n` consisting of integers from 1 to `m` such that the array satisfies some conditions related to the number of increasing subsequences. Specifically, it appears to count the number of arrays where there are exactly `k` increasing subsequences. The code uses dynamic programming to solve this problem.

## Dynamic Programming Approach:
The code uses a 3D dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` to store intermediate results. Let's break down how this DP array is used and the logic behind it:

1. `dp[i][j][p]`: This 3D array represents the number of ways to construct an array of length `i` with the last element being `j` and having `p` increasing subsequences.

2. Initialize `dp[0][0][0] = 1` as the base case, which means there's one way to create an empty array with zero increasing subsequences.

3. The code then iterates through all possible states for `i`, `j`, and `p` using nested loops. Here's what each loop does:
   - The outer loop iterates over the length of the array from 0 to `n-1`.
   - The second loop, `for (int j = 0; j <= m; j++)`, iterates over the possible last elements of the array, from 0 to `m`.
   - The third loop, `for (int p = 0; p <= k; p++)`, represents the number of increasing subsequences.

4. Inside the nested loops, there's another loop `for (int q = 1; q <= m; q++)` that iterates over the possible next elements of the array.

5. Depending on whether `q` is greater than `j` or not, the code updates the DP values as follows:
   - If `q > j`, it means `q` is a greater element, and the number of increasing subsequences increases by 1 (`p + 1`). So, it updates `dp[i + 1][q][p + 1]` with the sum of its current value and `dp[i][j][p]`.
   - If `q <= j`, it means `q` is not greater, so it doesn't change the number of increasing subsequences. It updates `dp[i + 1][j][p]` with the sum of its current value and `dp[i][j][p]`.

6. After filling the DP array for all possible states, the code calculates the total count of arrays with `n` elements, `k` increasing subsequences, and the last element being any integer from 1 to `m`. This is done in the following loop:


7. Finally, the code returns `count`, which represents the total count of arrays that meet the specified conditions.

In essence, this code employs dynamic programming to build a 3D table of states and computes the number of valid arrays with the given length, maximum element value, and the specified number of increasing subsequences.
