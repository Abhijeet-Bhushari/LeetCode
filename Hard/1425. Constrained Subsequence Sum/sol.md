## Approach: Dynamic Programming with Deque

### Intuition

To find the maximum sum of a non-empty subsequence, we can use dynamic programming (DP). We define `dp[i]` as the maximum sum of a non-empty subsequence of `nums[:i+1]`. The result we seek is the maximum value in the `dp` array. Initially, we can compute `dp[i]` using the recurrence `dp[i] = nums[i] + max(dp[i-k], dp[i-k+1], ..., dp[i-1])`. However, this approach would be too slow and result in a Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) error. To optimize it, we use a deque data structure to keep track of the maximum value within a sliding window.

### Algorithm

1. Initialize a deque `q` to store indices.
2. Create a `dp` array with the same length as `nums` and initialize it with the values of `nums`.
3. Iterate through the `nums` array from left to right (index `i` from 1 to `nums.size()`):
   - While the deque `q` is not empty and the index at the back of `q` is out of the window of size `k`, pop the back element from `q`.
   - While the deque is not empty and the `dp` value at the front index of `q` is smaller than `dp[i]`, pop the front element from `q`.
   - Append the current `dp[i]` value to the deque `q`.
   - Update `dp[i]` by taking the maximum between its current value and `dp[q[0]] + nums[i]`. This step captures the idea of maximizing the subsequence sum while adhering to the constraint.
4. After the loop, the result is the maximum value in the `dp` array, which can be found using the `max_element` function.
5. Return the result as the answer.

### Complexity

- Time complexity: O(N) where N is the length of the `nums` array.
- Space complexity: O(K), where K is the constraint that limits the size of the deque.
