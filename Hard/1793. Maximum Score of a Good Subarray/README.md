Maximum Score of a Good Subarray
This Java code helps you find the maximum possible score of a good subarray in an array of integers. A good subarray is defined as one where i <= k <= j, and the score of a subarray is calculated as min(nums[i], nums[i+1], ..., nums[j]) * (j - i + 1). The code uses a specific algorithm to find the optimal subarray that maximizes this score.

Usage
To use this code, follow these steps:

Copy the code and paste it into your Java project.

Implement the maxGoodSubarrayScore method, passing in the array of integers (nums) and the integer k as parameters.

The method will return the maximum possible score for a good subarray according to the defined algorithm.

Method Description
maxGoodSubarrayScore(int[] nums, int k)
This method calculates the maximum possible score for a good subarray in the given array nums using a specific algorithm.

Parameters:

nums: An array of integers.
k: The integer representing the pivot point.
Returns: The maximum possible score of a good subarray.
